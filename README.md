My name is Augusto Baffa and I'm a Lecturer and Researcher at PUC-Rio University (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m interested in Artificial Intelligence, Optimization and Operational Research (specially uncertainty and markovian models). Generally, I'm working on emotional / social models for Game AI and Game Theory or optimization problems but since pandemics I've been learning computer hardware design and low level programming.

- ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m currently studying and working on retro computing solutions. Why? It's old stuff but most of actual hardware have the same concepts. Also, it's easier to understand and manipulate and I grew up in the 80's when many of these computers and hardware available.
